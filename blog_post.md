### **A Controlled Dataset for Calibration: The Uniform Color-Shifted CIFAR-10**

In machine learning research, understanding why a model fails is as important as measuring its success. Modern deep neural networks, despite their high accuracy, often suffer from being overconfident [1] and brittle when faced with data that differs even slightly from what they were trained on[3]. This is a critical issue in safety-conscious fields like autonomous driving, where a model that is "99% sure" but wrong can lead to accidents[3].

To properly diagnose these failures, we need controlled environments where we can isolate specific variables.

#### **What is the Dataset?**

The dataset is a modified version of the well-known CIFAR-10 test set. The modification is intentionally simple and deterministic:

* **A Uniform Color Shift:** A constant value of `+32` is added to each of the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) channels for every pixel in every image.
* **Deterministic Generation:** The process is entirely deterministic, meaning every researcher who runs the generation script will produce the exact same dataset. This is crucial for reproducible science.

This creates a new test set where the core content and composition of the images are identical to the original, but the overall brightness is uniformly increased.

#### **Why is This Interesting?**

A simple color shift might seem trivial, but it creates a powerful tool for analyzing model behavior for several reasons:

1.  **Isolating a Single Variable:** Real-world data can shift in countless ways. By only changing one factor—uniform brightness—we can directly attribute any change in model performance (like accuracy or calibration) solely to that factor. This allows for a precise, scientific investigation into a model's robustness.

2.  **Simulating a Plausible Scenario:** While artificial, this shift mimics a common real-world problem. A self-driving car's camera system, for instance, will encounter scenes under varying lighting conditions, from a bright sunny day to an overcast one[3]. This makes the experiment relevant.

3.  **A Precise Test for Calibration:** The dataset is not designed to trick a model's accuracy but to challenge its **confidence**. It allows us to ask specific questions: When the visual world gets uniformly brighter, does the model become more or less confident? Does its confidence still align with its actual accuracy? This provides a focused test for the reliability of its uncertainty estimates, often measured with metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE)[1].

4.  **A Rapid Benchmarking Tool:** Because the dataset is small and the shift is simple, it enables rapid testing and comparison of different uncertainty quantification methods. Techniques like Deep Ensembles, MC-Dropout, or the Laplace Approximation [2, 3] can be quickly evaluated against this specific challenge to see how they perform, providing valuable insights without the cost of large-scale retraining.

#### **Implementation and Testing**

An implementation to generate this dataset and test models against it is available and **can be found in the repo**. The repository includes scripts and detailed instructions for:
* Generating the color-shifted dataset from the original CIFAR-10.
* Training a baseline model on the original data.
* Evaluating the model's performance and calibration on the new, shifted data.
* Applying and testing post-hoc uncertainty methods, such as the Laplace approximation[2, 3].
